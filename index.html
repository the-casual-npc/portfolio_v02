            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ondřej (Andrew), a curious student developer, and this is my portfolio website. I'm 16 years old, and I'm from the Czech Republic, so I speak both Czech and English. I'm a student at Creative Hill College, studying the Development of video games and multimedia applications. I also LOVE the Lexend font!</p>
            <p>I specialize in web development and Python, and So far, I have made complete projects using HTML and CSS, JavaScript and Python. I like learning new things, including C# in Unity, Luau in Roblox Studio, Kotlin in Android Studio, and more.</p>

                    <p>The obvious one. This field is rather large, from building computers, understanding how they work, software, video editing, and of course - games.</p>

                    <p>Believe it or not, i go outside sometimes. I've always loved water which evolved into Freediving - Diving on a single breath, without some fancy equipment.</p>

            <p>When a project is clicked, it stays visible, so you don't have to hover your cursor over it to read it.</p>

                <h3>Highlive Website</h3>
                <p>This is a website for Highlive - a Czech Company doing repairs and stuff at heights, and other places where it's hard to get to.</p>
                <p>For this Website, I didn't use much fancy Javascript to keep it professional, but I tried to make it look somewhat friendly. It's made entirely in Czech, and It's hosted at <a href="https://highlive.jednoduse.cz" target="_blank">highlive.jednoduse.cz</a>, so you can check it out!</p>

                <h3>Death Note Website</h3>
                <p>This is a website about the anime Death Note. In school we got assigned to make a website presentation about a film or a series we liked, so i chose Death Note for it's distinct theme.</p>
                <p>The website consists of a heropage and some subpages for the lore, characters, etc. This page was my first introduction to JavaScript, so it was pretty exciting. It is also entirely in Czech. It's hosted at <a href="https://the-casual-npc.github.io/deathNote_website" target="blank">https://the-casual-npc.github.io/deathNote_website</a>.</p>

                <h3>Game of Life</h3>
                <p>While learning python at school, we got assigned multiple projects, including this one. It is a Python recreation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Convey's Game of Life</a>.</p>
                <p>The project was made using PyCharm, and in the game, you can choose the size of the game board, the percentage starting with live cells (the placement is random), and the number of iterations the game runs for. The game is using ASCII art for its design.</p>

                <h3>The Maze Game</h3>
                <p>This is another python school project. Once you start the game you can move around the maze using W, A, S, D. The goal is to get to the exit while avoiding traps and enemies.</p>
                <p>The maze is randomly generated each time, with selectable size. There are toggleable enemies, traps, healing potions and fog of war. It was also made in PyCharm. The game can be saved and loaded anytime. The menus are designed with a combination of ASCII art and emojis.</p>
